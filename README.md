# bgpIP
just a handy small Py. script to get all the ips from bgp view. 

Just Run:
```
python3 bgpIP.py -u company -k "keyword to filter in the search resault"
Eg.: python3 bgpIP.py -u dell -k "Dell, Inc."
```

Note: i haven't filtered ipv6 yet so you have to either write a regex for it or copy paste the 4s in a different file.
